'''
Variable Naming:
- We can put numbers but they cannot be at the beginning --> variable123
- We cannot enter spaces in a variable, we use underscore 
to separate words --> contestant_1
- We use "snake_casing", a convention that is very pythonic 
to name variables --> last_name
- You CANT name a variable as a Python reserved word.
- Make sure your name makes sense --> x, p invalid -- 
- Constants such as 3.14, can be defined in UPPERCASE --> PI = 3.14159
