Variables: are like lables for values. We store these values to:
- Refer back to them later
- Use that value --> do anything with it 
- We can change the value later on

- Let's visualize a variable as a Jar that has a value in it an a label associated 
with it. We can always refer back to the label to use the value.
- For each variable, Python assigns an space in memory

How to we define variables?
Ex: age = 48
- The equals sign is the Assingment operator
